This is a new [**React Native**](https://reactnative.dev) project, bootstrapped using [`@react-native-community/cli`](https://github.com/react-native-community/cli).

# Getting Started

> **Note**: Make sure you have completed the [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/set-up-your-environment) guide before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start Metro

First, you will need to run **Metro**, the JavaScript build tool for React Native.

To start the Metro dev server, run the following command from the root of your React Native project:

```sh
# Using npx
npx react-native start
```
## Step 2: Build and run your app

The first time clone the project, run below:
npm install


### Android

```sh
# Using npm
npx react-native run android
```

### iOS

For iOS, 

The first time clone the project, run Pods itself:

cd ios
```

Then, and every time you update your native dependencies, run:

```sh
pod install
```

```sh
# Using npm
npx react-native run ios
```

If everything is set up correctly, you should see your new app running in the Android Emulator, iOS Simulator, or your connected device.

This is one way to run your app â€” you can also build it directly from Android Studio or Xcode.
